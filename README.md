# Modelling the South African Cholera Outbreak of 2000-2001

In this project, we first created a mathematical model to best represent the data given to us then added control mechanism terms to the model to improve the fit.

## Requirements:
To run this are: Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, lmfit

## 1. Epidemic Model without any control mechanisms:


## 2. Epidemic Model with control mechanisms included:


## 3. Determine which of the control mechanisms are the most efficient:


## 4. Predict future trends:
