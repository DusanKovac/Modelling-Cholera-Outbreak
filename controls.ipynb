The argument implied by this is that there is a linear relationship between the amount of (infected) feces in the system and the amount of susceptible people the feces will affect (that is, $x$ amount of contagious fecal matter will always infect $y$ amount of people, as long as there's at least $y$ susceptible people). Whether this assumption is reasonable is definitely up for debate."

By introducing $w_1$ as a coefficient to each term that contains $\\alpha$, the recovery rate, we are effectively increasing the recovery rate. This is equivalent to just updating the parameter $\\alpha$ and not bothering with the $w_1$ coefficient, but I believe that preserving the original model's value of $\\alpha$ makes both interpretation and comparison between control mechanisms easier. Since the recovery rate of the infected population will not directly affect the susceptible population, $w_1$ does not depend on $S$ and does not directly affect $S'$.\n",
